# Security Response Playbook

## Immediate Response to Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Assessment Phase (0-1 hours)
- [ ] Evaluate the severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Identify affected systems and environments
- [ ] Determine if the vulnerability is actively exploited
- [ ] Check if the vulnerability affects production systems

### 2. Immediate Mitigation (1-4 hours)
For **Critical/High** severity vulnerabilities:

#### For Dependency Vulnerabilities:
```bash
# Check affected packages
npm audit

# For transitive dependencies, use resolutions/overrides
# Add to package.json:
{
  "resolutions": {
    "vulnerable-package": ">=fixed-version"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "vulnerable-package": ">=fixed-version"  
  }
}

# Update lockfile
npm install
```

#### For Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:
```bash
# Check Terraform security
terraform plan -detailed-exitcode

# Apply immediate fixes
terraform apply -target=resource.security_fix
```

### 3. Testing Phase (2-8 hours)
- [ ] Run automated security scans
- [ ] Verify the fix doesn't break functionality
- [ ] Test in dev/staging environments
- [ ] Update test cases if needed

### 4. Deployment Phase (4-24 hours)
- [ ] Deploy to dev environment first
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Deploy to staging/QA
- [ ] Deploy to production with monitoring
- [ ] Verify fix in production

### 5. Documentation Phase (24-48 hours)
- [ ] Update security advisory
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update playbooks if needed
- [ ] Communicate to stakeholders

## Automated Tools

### GitHub Actions Workflows
```yaml
# Weekly security scans
- dependency-security.yml
- security-scan.yml
- infra-security.yml

# On every PR
- terraform-lint.yml (includes security checks)
```

### Security Scanning Tools

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Proactive Monitoring
- Enable GitHub Dependabot alerts
- Weekly automated vulnerability scans
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Security newsletter subscriptions

### 2. Secure Development Practices
- Security-focused code reviews
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
- Regular dependency updates
- Principle of least privilege

### 3. Infrastructure Hardening
- Regular security assessments
- Automated compliance checking
- Infrastructure as Code security scanning
- Network segmentation and monitoring
