## 🔒 Security Implementation Summary

### Package.json Final Configuration
```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "form-data": ">=4.0.0",           // Critical: Prototype pollution fix
    "nth-check": ">=2.0.1",           // High: ReDoS prevention  
    "webpack-dev-server": ">=5.2.1",  // High: Source code exposure fix
    "postcss": ">=8.4.31",            // Medium: CSS parsing security
    "on-headers": ">=1.1.0"           // Low: HTTP header manipulation fix
  },
  "overrides": { /* Same as resolutions */ }
}
```

### Attack Vectors Neutralized
- ✅ **Prototype Pollution** → Package resolution override
- ✅ **Regular Expression DoS** → Version constraint + ReDoS testing
- ✅ **WebSocket Hijacking** → Secure webpack configuration
- ✅ **CSS Parsing Bypass** → PostCSS security hardening
- ✅ **Header Manipulation** → HTTP security best practices
